=== CHANGES ===
LucidWorks for Solr 3.1.0_01 has the following changes compared
to Apache Solr 3.1.0

* SOLR-2455: Prevent double submit of forms in admin interface.
  (Jeffrey Chang via uschindler)

* SOLR-2464: Fix potential slowness in QueryValueSource (the query()
  function) when the query is very sparse and may not match any documents
  in a segment. (yonik)

* SOLR-2469: When using java replication with replicateAfter=startup, the
  first commit point on server startup is never removed. (yonik)

* LUCENE-2996: addIndexes(IndexReader) did not flush before adding the new 
  indexes, causing existing deletions to be applied on the incoming indexes
  as well. (Shai Erera, Mike McCandless)

* SOLR-2466: SolrJ's CommonsHttpSolrServer would retry requests on failure, regardless
  of the configured maxRetries, due to HttpClient having it's own retry mechanism
  by default.  The retryCount of HttpClient is now set to 0, and SolrJ does
  the retry.  (yonik)

* SOLR-2409: edismax parser - treat the text of a fielded query as a literal if the
  fieldname does not exist.  For example Mission: Impossible should not search on
  the "Mission" field unless it's a valid field in the schema.  (Ryan McKinley, yonik)

* SOLR-2403: facet.sort=index reported incorrect results for distributed search
  in a number of scenarios when facet.mincount>0.  This patch also adds some
  performance/algorithmic improvements when (facet.sort=count && facet.mincount=1
  && facet.limit=-1) and when (facet.sort=index && facet.mincount>0)  (yonik)
